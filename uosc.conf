# `chapter_ranges` lets you define custom range indicators that will be parsed out from
# chapters, identified by chapter titles, and displayed in progressbar and seekbar.
# This requires that someone or something makes chapters that identify these ranges in their titles.
#
# Syntax 1: "<start-str>-<end-str>:<color>:<opacity>"
# Syntax 2: "<range-str>:<color>:<opacity>"
#
# Multiple chapter ranges can be defined by separating them with comma:
#
# chapter_ranges=<range1>,<range2>,<range3>
#
# `<start-str>`, `<end-str>`, and `<range-str>` only have to occur in a title, they don't have to match it completely.
# If only one `<range-str>` is specified, ranges will be created from consecutive pairs of this type of chapters.
#
# Example:
#
# Display skippable youtube video sponsor blocks from https://github.com/po5/mpv_sponsorblock
#
# chapter_ranges=Sponsor start-Sponsor end:968638:0.5
